#### performance tuning
# Inter process communication simulation delay, just to get the performance results faster(testing purposes).
operation.delay=5
# I've done the partitioning based on the userId's hash(consistent hashing).
# Each partition can be processed in parallel by a dedicated thread.
# This maximizes throughput and ensures that the processing load is evenly distributed across available threads.
# Right now, we have 2 concurrent consumers(check MessageConsumer.java), so we can process data in 2 partitions with 2 dedicated active consumers.
partition.count=2
# Batching allows multiple messages to be sent together in a single network request.
# The 16KB batch size is large enough to reduce the network load, also small enough to process multiple batches concurrently without running into memory issues.
# Estimation:
#   each message size = ~35
#   16,384 / 35 = 468 messages per batch
spring.kafka.producer.batch-size=16384
# This parameter show that how much record on each poll will be requested. (from the consumer point of view)
# This has been set based on the estimation for producer's batch.size.
# Alignment of max.poll.records with batch.size leads to a more consistent producer/consumer behaviour.
# It will reduce the end-to-end latency because consumer can process data as soon as it's available.
# In the consumers(check MessageConsumer.java) the batch option has been set to `true` to enable batch processing
